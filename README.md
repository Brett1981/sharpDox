Create documentation with ease
------------------

**sharpDox** is a documentation tool to create c# code documentation of any type.
The tool creates a model of a given c# solution and passes it to the registered export plugins.
The plugins transform the model to a defined output. **sharpDox** comes with a chm & html export plugin which
demonstrate the possibilities of the tool.

[This](http://sharpdox.de/en/doc/) is an example for a html documentation.
